# Mathematical Modeling Algorithms

This repo contains the implementation of some convenient tools for mathematical modeling, including AHP, TOPSIS, PCA, etc.

# Commonly Used Models

In addition to the above algorithms, I also included some commonly seen models (e.g., disease models, Lotka Volterra models, population models, linear programming).
